    <ol>
        <li><strong>Your GetSilencil.com Account and Site.</strong> If you create a blog/site on the

            responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with
            the blog. You must not describe or assign keywords to your blog in a misleading or unlawful manner,
            including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and GetSilencil            may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise
            likely to cause GetSilencil liability. You must immediately
            notify GetSilencil of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account or any other breaches
            of security. GetSilencil will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any
            damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> If you operate a blog, comment on a blog, post material to
            the Website, post links on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material
            available by means of the Website (any such material, &quot;Content&quot;), You are entirely responsible for
            the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the
            Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content
            available, you represent and warrant that:
            <ul>
                <li>the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including
                    but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
                </li>
                <li>if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received
                    permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to
                    any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
                </li>
                <li>you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all
                    things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
                </li>
                <li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful
                    or destructive content;
                </li>
                <li class='important'>the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not
                    contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or
                    boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as
                    phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);

                <li>your blog is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another
                    person or company. For example, your blog's URL or name is not the name of a person other than
                    yourself or company other than your own; and
                </li>
                <li>you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or
                    described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by
					GetSilencil or otherwise.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By submitting Content to GetSilencil for inclusion on your Website, you
                grant GetSilencil a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce,
                modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting

                from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made
                immediately unavailable.</p>
            <p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, GetSilencil has the right
                (though not the obligation) to, in GetSilencil's sole discretion (i) refuse or
                remove any content that, in GetSilencil's reasonable opinion, violates
                any GetSilencil policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or
                deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason,
                in GetSilencil's sole discretion. GetSilencil will have no
